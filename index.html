            <p class="answer"> <span>Ans:- </span> ChatGPT is fine-tuned from GPT-3.5, a language model trained to
                produce text. ChatGPT was
                optimized for dialogue by using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) â€“ a method that uses
                human demonstrations and preference comparisons to guide the model toward desired behavior.</p>

                <h3 class="question">Q. Why does the AI seem so real and lifelike? </h3>

            </div>
            <p class="answer"> <span>Ans:- </span> These models were trained on vast amounts of data from the internet
                written by humans,
                including conversations, so the responses it provides may sound human-like. It is important to keep in
                mind that this is a direct result of the system's design (i.e. maximizing the similarity between outputs
                and the dataset the models were trained on) and that such outputs may be inaccurate, untruthful, and
                otherwise misleading at times.</p>

                <h3 class="question">Q. Can I trust that the AI is telling me the truth?</h3>

            </div>
            <p class="answer"> <span>Ans:- </span> ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally
                produce incorrect
                answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce
                harmful instructions or biased content.
                We'd recommend checking whether responses from the model are accurate or not. If you find an answer is
                incorrect, please provide that feedback by using the "Thumbs Down" button.</p>
